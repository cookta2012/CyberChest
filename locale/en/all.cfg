[entity-description]
cyberchest = Addition to an assembling machine. Set request slots for production queue, and press Start.

[technology-description]
cyberfusion_1 = Cyberchests are partially merged with assemblers, increasing their speed by 50% (Energy consumption +70%, chest consumption - 100kW)
cyberfusion_2 = Assembler speed +100% (Energy consumption +140%)
cyberfusion_3 = Assembler speed +200% (Energy consumption +280%)
cyberfusion_4 = Assembler speed +400% (Energy consumption +560%)

burst_input_1 =  By inserting several stacks at once, cyberchest now can catch up to assemblers with crafting speed up to 3 (base 1.5)
burst_input_2 = Cyberchest now can catch up to assemblers with crafting speed up to 6 (base 1.5)
burst_input_3 = Cyberchest now can catch up to assemblers with crafting speed up to 12(base 1.5)
burst_input_4 = Cyberchest now can catch up to assemblers with almost any crafting speed
cyberchest = Addition to an assembling machine. When built next to an assembling machine, enables production of multiple item types.  
cyberarms = Every cyberchest will be equipped with a set of long, flexible arms. This allows it to directly collect items from ground in 9x9 square.
inventory-override = Bypasses inventory limit, allowing cyberchests to insert items into the off-limit slots.
